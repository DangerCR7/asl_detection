## Introduction
This project aims to create a Machine Learning model capable of detecting American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time. The model utilizes computer vision techniques to interpret sign language, providing a valuable tool for communication and education.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DangerCR7/asl_detection.git
cd asl_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the ASL detection model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your webcam is connected and operational.
2. Run the main script to start the ASL detection:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The application will start capturing video from your webcam and will display the detected ASL gestures in real-time.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/` - Contains the datasets used for training the model.
- `models/` - Contains pre-trained models and training scripts.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model training.
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for data preprocessing and augmentation.
- `main.py` - The main script to run the ASL detection application.
- `requirements.txt` - A list of dependencies required to run the project.
